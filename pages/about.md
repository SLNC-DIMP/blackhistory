Black History Month is celebrated each year to honor and recognize the rich history and accomplishments of African Americans in our nation. In the early 1900s historian Carter G. Woodson completed research on the history of African Americans in the United States.  He created a Black History exhibit in Chicago as part of celebration of the 50th anniversary of emancipation and later founded a journal in which he published his articles on Black life and history. In 1926, Woodson announced a Black History week in February. Through this celebration he was hoping to expand research on the life and history of African Americans further than the most well-known figures like Frederick Douglass.

Woodson advocated that the celebratory week should be a showcase of the work students and historians were doing throughout the year indicating that research on Black life and history shouldn't be constrained to a short one-week time frame.  The week long celebration was extended to the full month of February. Gerald Ford was the first president to recognize the month in 1976 and every president since has designated February as Black History month.
